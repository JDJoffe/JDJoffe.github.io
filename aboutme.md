### Intro 
Hi, I'm joshua and growing up I've always been interested in technology and dreamed of making things. After trying computer science in highschool I really felt I found what I wanted to do for my forseable future. 

### Education
I am a recent diploma graduate from TAFE Hornsby. With their help, I worked as a full-stack developer having created projects using React native and the .Net framework, each project using database technologies such as MongoDB and SQL Server respectively. <br>
Previously, I also completed a diploma of games programming with TAFE St'Leonards, collaborating with those in the games art course. Even though after completion I saw that I would rather pursue other industries involving software development, the course taught me how to work with others of different skill sets.

### Epilogue
I hope to become a valued member of a team, working with others of different skills and backgrounds. <br>
I'm always happy to learn more. Reach out to me through my links in the footer below.
